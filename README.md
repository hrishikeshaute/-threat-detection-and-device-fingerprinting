# -threat-detection-and-device-fingerprinting

This code is designed to monitor network traffic and detect anomalous behavior in real-time using machine learning. Specifically, it uses anomaly detection with the Isolation Forest algorithm from scikit-learn to identify outliers in network packets. It provides a Flask-based web interface that displays alerts for anomalies detected in network traffic.

Key Uses:
Real-Time Network Monitoring:
The system continuously sniffs network packets and processes them to monitor for unusual or suspicious activity. This could be used in environments such as enterprise networks, IoT devices, or home networks.
Anomaly Detection:
The core of the system is the Isolation Forest model, which identifies packets that significantly differ from the majority of traffic. These differences are flagged as anomalies. This can help in detecting potential security threats, such as:
Malicious traffic (e.g., DDoS attacks, unauthorized data transmission).
Network misconfigurations or unexpected patterns.
Intrusions or devices sending unusual amounts of data.
Network Security:
By identifying anomalies in network traffic, the system can help in detecting cybersecurity breaches, such as network intrusions, botnet activity, or malware communication with external servers.
IoT Device Fingerprinting:
It can be used in IoT networks to identify devices based on their network traffic patterns. Anomalies in traffic could signal new or unauthorized devices joining the network, which could then trigger alerts to security teams.
Automated Alert System:
The Flask web app serves as a user interface where alerts are displayed in real-time. This makes it easy for network administrators or security teams to quickly view and respond to detected anomalies.
Network Traffic Analysis:
The packet features extracted (source and destination IP, packet size, timestamp) could be useful for network traffic analysis and identifying patterns that are typical of different devices or applications.
Example Use Cases:
Corporate Networks: Detect abnormal network activity that could indicate a security breach or an insider threat.
IoT Networks: Monitor and protect networks of IoT devices from attacks or unauthorized access.
Home Networks: Personal use for monitoring network activity in a home environment, ensuring no devices are sending abnormal traffic.
How it Works:
Packet Sniffing:

It uses Scapy, a Python library for network packet manipulation, to capture packets from the network.
The packets are analyzed for key features like source IP, destination IP, packet size, and timestamp.
Anomaly Detection:

The Isolation Forest model is used to detect outliers or anomalies in the network traffic. Itâ€™s trained with the packet data (size and timestamp) and flags any unusual traffic.
When the model identifies a packet as anomalous, it generates an alert indicating potential suspicious activity.
Web Interface:

A Flask web application serves as a front-end interface, displaying the alerts in real-time.
Network administrators or security personnel can visit the web interface to check for any detected anomalies.
Background Sniffing:

The packet sniffing and analysis happen in the background (on a separate thread), allowing the Flask app to function without interruptions.
